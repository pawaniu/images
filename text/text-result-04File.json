    "The term pricing is used broadly to describe the calculation of prices (for external use by customers or vendors) and costs (for\ninternal purposes, such as cost accounting). Conditions represent a set of circumstances that apply when a price is calculated.\nFor example, a particular customer orders a certain quantity of a particular product on a certain day. The variable factors here\nthe customer, the product, the order quantity, the date - determine the final price the customer gets. The information about\n\neach of these factors can be stored in the system as master data. This master data is stored in the form of condition records .\n\f",
    "The condition technique refers to the method by which the system determines prices from information stored in condition\n\u2018ecords. In Sales and Distribution, the various elements used in the condition technique are set up and controlled in\nCustomizing. During sales order processing, the system uses the condition technique to determine a variety of important\noricing information. For example, the system automatically determines which gross price the customer should be charged an\nwhich discounts and surcharges are relevant given the conditions that apply.\n\f",
    "The most important basic functions are:\n\f",
    "The following figure shows how the condition technique works in the background to produce the pricing information. The\ndiagram shows how the various elements in the condition technique work together.\n\f",

    "The condition technique is an infrastructure that helps to define master data and to configure the determination of the master\ndata. The master data are called condition records and are persisted in condition tables. To configure the determination, it uses\nthe elements procedure, condition type, and access sequence. The content of the condition technique can be structured\naccording to the following dimensions:\n\f",
    "3. Each condition type in the pricing procedure can have an access sequence assigned to it. In this case, the system uses\naccess sequence PROO. The system checks the accesses until it finds a valid condition record. (Although you cannot see\nthis in the diagram, each access specifies a particular condition table. The table provides the key with which the system\nsearches for records).\n\f",
    "For further information on the condition technique, see Introduction to the Condition Technique\n\f",
    "5. The system determines the price according to information stored in the condition record. If a pricing scale exists, the\nsystem calculates the appropriate price. In the example, the sales order item is for 120 pieces of the material. Using the\nscale price that applies to quantities from 100 pieces and more, the system determines a price of USD 99 per piece.\n\f",
    "The system repeats this process for each condition type in the pricing procedure determines a final price.\n\f",
